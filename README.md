# AI Voice Chat

## Description

AI Voice Chat is a Python-based application that allows users to interact with an AI-powered chatbot via voice. The chatbot is built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies. The system converts speech into text, processes the input through the AI, and then converts the response back to speech.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken words into text.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts AI-generated responses into speech.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: AI understands and responds to user queries in a conversational manner.
- **Customizable Voices**: Users can choose different voices for TTS.
- **Language Support**: Supports multiple languages for both speech recognition and speech synthesis.

- Python 3.x
- `pip` (Python package installer)
- A microphone for speech input and speakers/headphones for output.
